### Steam Startup Fix.ahk
Sometimes (if steam is in autostart) it starts and looks up in the taskbar as a tray icon, but doesn't show up as a windows if you're trying to start it, this program is killing the process and starting steam up again <br/>

### Folder Opener.ahk

A small program that lets you open a few folders, it's pretty useful for me, but if you want to use it for yourself, you need to change everything like folder locations to your own
