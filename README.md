### [Steam Startup Fix.ahk](https://github.com/MaxiAmZocken/AutoHotkey-Projects/blob/main/Steam%20Startup%20Fix.ahk)
Sometimes (if steam is in autostart) it starts and looks up in the taskbar as a tray icon, but won't show up as a window, if you click it. This ahk-script is killing the process and starting steam up again, this usually fixes the problem <br/>

### [Folder Opener.ahk](https://github.com/MaxiAmZocken/AutoHotkey-Projects/blob/main/Small%20Shortcuts/Folder%20Opener.ahk)

A small program that lets you open a few folders, it's pretty useful for me, but if you want to use it for yourself, you need to change everything like folder locations to your own

### [Download Programs.ahk](https://github.com/MaxiAmZocken/AutoHotkey-Projects/tree/main/Download%20Programs)

A small program that lets you simply open the download sites to download stuff quicker on new pc's (there are only a few programs for now, but I'm gonna add more in the future)

### [(Opera) Edit Websites without Inspect.ahk](https://github.com/MaxiAmZocken/AutoHotkey-Projects/blob/main/Small%20Shortcuts/(Opera)%20Edit%20Websites%20without%20Inspect.ahk)
With this little Script (it's only a few lines long), you are able to edit the web like a text editor (only works for opera i think) <br/>
(You could just open the console and type document.designMode = "on", but this is more fancy)
