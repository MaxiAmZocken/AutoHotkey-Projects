### [Steam Startup Fix.ahk](https://github.com/MaxiAmZocken/AutoHotkey-Projects/blob/main/Steam%20Startup%20Fix.ahk)
Sometimes (if steam is in autostart) it starts and looks up in the taskbar as a tray icon, but won't show up as a window, if you click it. This ahk-script is killing the process and starting steam up again, this usually fixes the problem <br/>

### [Folder Opener.ahk](https://github.com/MaxiAmZocken/AutoHotkey-Projects/blob/main/Folder%20Opener/Folder%20Opener.ahk)

A small program that lets you open a few folders, it's pretty useful for me, but if you want to use it for yourself, you need to change everything like folder locations to your own

### [Download Programs.ahk](https://github.com/MaxiAmZocken/AutoHotkey-Projects/blob/main/Download%20Programs/Download%20Programs.ahk)

A small program that lets you simply open the download sites to download stuff quicker on new pc's (there are only a few programs for now, but I'm gonna add more in the future)
